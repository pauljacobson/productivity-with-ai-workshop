# Productivity with AI workshop

Analysis for my Productivity with AI workshop presented in May 2023 in Prague.

My code was drawn partly from example code that I used in the [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers course through DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/).

My goal was to analyze responses from my team to a short survey that I created about their use of, and thoughts about, LLMs and generative AI tools as productivity tools.
