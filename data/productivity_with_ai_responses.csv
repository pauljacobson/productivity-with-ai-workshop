They seem to be the host helpful and having access to the internet with them makes them very powerful.,"Efficiency, productivity, helping me answer questions my knowledge is lacking, having a fast, good overall understanding of the user and their account. It would be great if we would have access to some sort of AI tool that can have access to user account information, like SA or blogRC so we could analyze the data faster!",- ,No,
5/14/2023 12:40:35,ChatGPT,I'd like to explore the image generating ones like Midjourney and Stable diffusion but didn't get to it. No particular reason other than to get familiar with them and build up some AI using muscle. Also excited to try others too. ,Their potential to help us up our game - both personally and professionally.,"I don't think I have enough context to really worry - so my worries are based on what I've been reading. I tend to err on the side of progress and innovation, and am generally an early adopter of stuff - but in this particular case there are ethical dilemmas that stand to the forefront. ",No,
5/14/2023 13:12:51,"ChatGPT, Bing AI, Google Bard","ChatGPT is the primary one I used, although I've been playing around with Bing and Bard as well recently. I'm hoping Bard will be included in search results, similar to Bing, since I primarily use Google Search / Chromimum browsers. 

ChatGPT has been helpful already in many ways: writing articles, reviewing code, reviewing interactions, writing up summaries, and I continue to underuse it simply because of habit and lack of time. I wish I could do every task with it, but at the moment, it still feels like it takes longer than necessary and requires additional mental capacity.","The integration of them in existing tools, so that it is not an additional step, but rather, part of the process, if that makes sense. Thats why I like how Edge is using Bing contextually.

I also love image generation AIs, and wish there was more time and purpose to use them. I think they truly create beautiful pieces of work.

I'm also excited at the potential future business that are spun out from using AI tools, and honestly, I wish I could spin something up of my own!","Honestly, the main concern I have is staying on top of all the new stuff that's happening literally every single day. It feels like it could be a full time job just to stay on top of the news, and still, I wouldn't know everything there is to know at any given point. 

I know we have an ai news channel and some P2s that share updates about it, but they are not as practical, and are simply interesting right now. Because there's so much happening, a week later you already forget all that you read.

I guess what would be ideal is to have a singular place I can go to for all of the above: prompts, creating art, finding information, contextualized or not, and something that has access to the internet, so it's always relevant and as correct as possible (without hallucinations).

I have personally bookmarked at least 20-30 of them, and perhaps it would be good to give a quick summary of what is out there to inspire people to get more involved with it. 

If at all possible, focusing on the practicality of it (i.e. how can each HE actually take the learnings and apply it to their life) is key to actually continue using it.",No,
